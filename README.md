# Hi there 👋

I’m a **Master’s student in Mathematical Engineering** at **Politecnico di Torino**.  
I’m passionate about **cybersecurity**, **cryptography**, and how these areas bridge theory with real-world applications.

🚗 I was part of my university’s **Formula Student team** for about **a year and a half**, where I contributed to projects focused on **autonomous driving systems**.

🔗 Recently, my main interests and projects have shifted toward **blockchain technologies**, especially within the **Solana ecosystem**.
